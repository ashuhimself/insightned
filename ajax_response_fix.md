## Contact Form JSON Response Fix

The issue with "Unexpected end of JSON input" has been resolved by:

1. Properly formatting the JSON error response in contact.php
2. Including the appropriate HTTP status code (400)
3. Ensuring proper error logging
4. Adding a single exit statement after sending the response

The contact form should now handle invalid JSON input correctly and provide proper feedback to the frontend.
